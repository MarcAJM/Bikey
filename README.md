# Bikey

This was an android app I created that was part of a project for one of my courses on TU/e. We wanted to make a bike lock you could unlock via your phone. Be aware that the code is not perfect because this was in the earlier stages of my study.

## Usage
1. Add your bike lock using the mac address you received in the packaging.
2. Next, verify the mac address by clicking on it. If it finds a bluetooth device with the right mac address, it verifies.
3. Click on your verified bike and check where you're bike was last seen or unlock it if you're in reach!
